  abstract = {Sleep duration and sleep quality are important predictors of risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). One potential link between sleep health and CVD is through lifestyle factors such as diet. To clarify the association between diet and sleep, we assessed the associations of sleep duration and insomnia symptoms with current Mediterranean-style diet (aMed) and with historical changes in aMed score. Actigraphy-measured sleep duration and self-reported insomnia symptoms categorized as insomnia with short sleep (\&lt;6 hr/night), insomnia without short sleep, no insomnia with short sleep, and no insomnia or short sleep were obtained from 2068 individuals who also had dietary intake data. A 10-point aMed score, derived from a self-report food frequency questionnaire, was collected concurrently with the sleep assessment and 10 years before. Compared with individuals who currently reported a low aMed score, those with a moderate-high aMed score were more likely to sleep 6--7 vs. \&lt;6 hr/night (p \&lt; 0.01) and less likely to report insomnia symptoms occurring with short sleep (vs. no insomnia or short sleep alone; p \&lt; 0.05). An increase in aMed score over the preceding 10 years was not associated with sleep duration or insomnia symptoms. However, compared with those with decreasing aMed score, individuals with an unchanging score reported fewer insomnia symptoms (p {$\leq$} 0.01). These results suggest that a Mediterranean-style diet is associated with adequate sleep duration, less insomnia symptoms, and less likely to have insomnia accompanied by short sleep. Further research should identify possible mediators through which diet may promote adequate sleep duration and reduce the risk of insomnia.},

  abstract = {Objective: To investigate sleep habits and their potential relationship with several sociodemographic, lifestyle and health related characteristics among indigenous and minority populations in Northeastern Greece. Materials and methods: Nine hundred fifty seven adults aged 19 to 86 years were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. Self-reported structured questionnaires were utilized. Results:The reported mean sleep duration on a weekly basis was 6:26{\textpm}1:10 hours (range, 04:00 to 10:00 hours); sleep duration was 26 min longer on weekends (p {$<$} 0.001). In multivariate linear regression analysis, older age ({$\beta$}=-26.7 min, p=0.010), being divorced or widowed ({$\beta$}=-29.0 min, p {$<$} 0.001), high alcohol ({$\beta$}=-39.7 min, p {$<$} 0.001) or coffee ({$\beta$}=-36.9 min, p=0.006) consumption, screen exposure before bedtime for 1-2 hours ({$\beta$}=-18.9 min, p=0.004) or {$>$} one hour ({$\beta$}=-34.4 min, p {$<$} 0.001), having a child aged under six years ({$\beta$}=-62.3 min, p {$<$} 0.001), napping for {$>$} 30 min during the day ({$\beta$}=-35.2 min, p {$<$} 0.001) and morbidity ({$\beta$}=-21.5 min, p {$<$} 0.001) were independently associated with short sleep duration and lower sleep efficiency. Moreover, a tendency towards short sleep duration was associated with anxiety ({$\beta$}=-8.8 min, p=0.078) and depression ({$\beta$}=-12.8 min, p=0.029). Obesity ({$\beta$}=10.7 min, p=0.047), being a university student ({$\beta$}=41.0 min, p=0.002), high financial status ({$\beta$}=16.6 min, p=0.037) and high adherence to Mediterranean diet ({$\beta$}=15.4 min, p=0.002) were associated with long sleep duration. Conclusion:This study illustrates the association of sleep disturbances with several sociodemographic and health-related factors and dictates conduction of larger scale prospective studies to evaluate causality on the relationship between sleep patterns and lifestyle factors.},

  abstract = {The prevalence of sleep disorders, characterized by issues with quality, timing, and sleep duration is increasing globally. Among modifiable risk factors, diet quality has been suggested to influence sleep features. The Mediterranean diet is considered a landmark dietary pattern in terms of quality and effects on human health. However, dietary habits characterized by this cultural heritage should also be considered in the context of overall lifestyle behaviors, including sleep habits. This study aimed to systematically revise the literature relating to adherence to the Mediterranean diet and sleep features in observational studies. The systematic review comprised 23 reports describing the relation between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and different sleep features, including sleep quality, sleep duration, daytime sleepiness, and insomnia symptoms. The majority of the included studies were conducted in the Mediterranean basin and reported a significant association between a higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet and a lower likelihood of having poor sleep quality, inadequate sleep duration, excessive daytime sleepiness or symptoms of insomnia. Interestingly, additional studies conducted outside the Mediterranean basin showed a relationship between the adoption of a Mediterranean-type diet and sleep quality, suggesting that biological mechanisms sustaining such an association may exist. In conclusion, current evidence suggests a relationship between adhering to the Mediterranean diet and overall sleep quality and different sleep parameters. The plausible bidirectional association should be further investigated to understand whether the promotion of a healthy diet could be used as a tool to improve sleep quality.},

  abstract = {Aim Although there is some evidence of the relationships between sleep duration/quality and nutrient and/or food intake, the associations between sleep and dietary patterns have been poorly explored. The aim of the present study was to evaluate sleep duration and quality in relation to adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MeDi), and to investigate the sex- and age-specific associations in a population-representative cohort of older adults. Methods Participants from the Hellenic Longitudinal Investigation of Aging and Diet were included. The sample consisted of 1639 adults aged {$\geq$}65 years. Sleep duration and quality were assessed through a self-report questionnaire, whereas adherence to the MeDi was evaluated by an a priori score. Results Sleep quality was positively associated with the MeDi in the unadjusted and the adjusted model (age, sex, depression, years of education, body mass index, level of physical activity and total energy intake were added as covariates). In contrast, sleep duration was not associated with MeDi adherence either in the unadjusted or the adjusted models. In relation to the age-related associations, sleep quality was positively associated with MeDi adherence in those aged {$\leq$}75 years, and not in those aged {$>$}75 years. Associations between sleep and MeDi did not differ between men and women. Conclusions The present results suggest that sleep quality is associated with MeDi adherence in older adults; there are also age-specific associations between sleep quality and the MeDi. Although additional studies are required, improvements in diet quality should be considered in the context of sleep management interventions in older individuals.

  abstract = {Objective To assess the relationship between diet pattern and prodromal Parkinson disease (PD) features. Methods These analyses include 47,679 participants from the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study. Since 1986, both cohorts have collected dietary information every 4 years and calculated scores for adherence to different diet patterns, including the alternate Mediterranean diet (aMED) and the Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI). In 2012, participants responded to questions regarding constipation and probable REM sleep behavior disorder. For a subset of 17,400 respondents to the 2012 questionnaire, 5 additional prodromal features of PD were assessed in 2014 to 2015. We used multinomial logistic regression to estimate the association between baseline (1986) diet pattern score quintiles and number of prodromal features (0, 1, 2, or {$\geq$}3) in 2012 to 2015. Additional analyses investigated the association between long-term adherence to these dietary patterns over 20 years and prodromal features suggestive of PD. Results In a comparison of extreme aMED diet quintiles, the odds ratio for {$\geq$}3 vs 0 features was 0.82 (95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.68--1.00, false discovery rate [FDR]--adjusted ptrend = 0.03) at baseline and 0.67 (95\% CI 0.54--0.83, FDR-ptrend {$<$} 0.001) for long-term diet; results were equally strong for the association with AHEI scores. Higher adherence to these diets was inversely associated with individual features, including constipation, excessive daytime sleepiness, and depression. Conclusions The inverse association between these diet patterns and prodromal PD features is consistent with previous findings and suggests that adherence to a healthy diet may reduce the occurrence of nonmotor symptoms that often precede PD diagnosis.},

  abstract = {Increasing evidence indicates that reactive oxygen species (ROS), consisting of superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, and multiple others, do not only cause oxidative stress, but rather may function as signaling molecules that promote health by preventing or delaying a number of chronic diseases, and ultimately extend lifespan. While high levels of ROS are generally accepted to cause cellular damage and to promote aging, low levels of these may rather improve systemic defense mechanisms by inducing an adaptive response. This concept has been named mitochondrial hormesis or mitohormesis. We here evaluate and summarize more than 500 publications from current literature regarding such ROS-mediated low-dose signaling events, including calorie restriction, hypoxia, temperature stress, and physical activity, as well as signaling events downstream of insulin/IGF-1 receptors, AMP-dependent kinase (AMPK), target-of-rapamycin (TOR), and lastly sirtuins to culminate in control of proteostasis, unfolded protein response (UPR), stem cell maintenance and stress resistance. Additionally, consequences of interfering with such ROS signals by pharmacological or natural compounds are being discussed, concluding that particularly antioxidants are useless or even harmful.},

  abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVES: To investigate relationships between sleep duration and adherence to healthy diets, but also associations with meal patterns, in a large population-based cohort. METHODS: Participants (n = 23,829, males and females, aged 45 to 75 years) from the Swedish EpiHealth cohort study were included in a cross-sectional analysis. The participants filled out an extensive Internet-based questionnaire, and also visited a test center for anthropometric measurements and blood sampling. Sleep duration was classified as short ({$<$} 6 h/night; n = 1,862), normal (6 to less fewer than 9 h/night; n = 19,907) and long sleep ({$\geq$} 9 h/night; n = 858). In addition, a combination variable of sleep duration (short/normal/long) and sleep quality (good/poor) was constructed, giving six categories. Adherence to a healthy diet was assessed using the modified Mediterranean diet (mMED) score and the Healthy Nordic Food Index (HNFI) score based on food groups from a food frequency questionnaire. A regular meal pattern was considered if the participant had breakfast, lunch and dinner on a daily basis. RESULTS: Compared with normal sleepers, short sleepers displayed lower adherence to a healthy diet when using both the mMED score (adjusted odds ratio = 0.70; 95\% confidence interval 0.56-0.88) and the HNFI score (0.70; 0.56--0.88). When combining sleep duration and sleep quality, short sleepers with poor sleep quality showed an independent relationship with low adherence to a healthy diet (0.67; 0.52--0.86) compared with normal sleepers with good sleep quality. In addition, both short sleepers (0.71; 0.62--0.82) and long sleepers (0.75; 0.62--0.91) showed low adherence to regular meal patterns, compared with normal sleepers. Furthermore, short sleepers with poor sleep quality had reduced odds of having a regular meal pattern (0.67; 0.57--0.79) as compared with normal sleepers with good sleep quality. CONCLUSIONS: Short sleep duration combined with poor sleep quality is associated with low adherence to a healthy diet and regular meal patterns.
